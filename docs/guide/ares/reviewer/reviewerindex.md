## No pending manuscripts

When you cannot find the manuscript that needs to be reviewed in the review center, the reasons may be as follows:

- **Removal from the Reviewer List Due to Special Circumstances**

  System notification emails are typically triggered if you are removed from the reviewer list for special circumstances, such as when the Managing Editor (ME) does not receive a response or identifies a conflict of interest with the author(s).

- **Automatic Closure of the Review Channel Upon Sufficient Feedback**

  If the review channel closes automatically because sufficient comments have been collected, we encourage you to contact the ME for confirmation. You may submit your review comments via email. If necessary, the ME will upload your comments to the system, and you will still receive full recognition for your review.

## How to obtain certificates

Locate the corresponding manuscript under **All Manuscripts** and complete the certificate download.

## Recognition for reviewers

The journal gratefully acknowledges the reviewers who dedicated their considerable time and expertise to the peer review process. And we seek to recognize the efforts of reviewers.

- The journal releases the annual reviewer acknowledgement to appreciate their contribution to the high-quality scientific content;
- A Reviewer Recognition Certificate will be awarded after the review;
- The journal encourages reviewers to register in Publons and add their review records there. Review records will be verified by the editorial office;
- The journal encourages reviewers to register for an ORCID iD and link it to their Publons account. Publons will automatically export the review history to the ORCID file.

Encourage users to complete their personal profiles within the Reviewer System. Completing your profile will allow you to:

- Receive more accurate review invitations matched to your expertise from OEP journals.
- Earn 0-10 points per manuscript based on the scores of review quality and efficiency (1 point = 1 USD).
- Qualify for reviewer recognition (e-certificates, annual highlights, and more).
- May qualify for a discount coupon for the next manuscript submission to any journal under Open Exploration Publishing (Sent via a separate email if applicable).
