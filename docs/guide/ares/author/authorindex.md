## Why has the Editorial Office not received the files I uploaded?

Answer:
When uploading files, confirm that a green checkmark icon ::material-symbols:check-circle-outline /#008000:: is displayed on the right side of each file—this is the indicator of successful single-file upload. After all files to be uploaded show this icon, be sure to click the <Badge type="tip" text="Submit" /> button at the bottom of the page to complete the entire upload process. If you only upload the files without clicking the Submit button, the files will not be uploaded to the platform, and the Editorial Office will not be able to receive them.

## How can I verify that the files have been successfully uploaded?

Answer:
Check the **"Recent uploads"** section at the bottom of the page. If the target files you intend to upload this time are displayed under the **"Author Proofreading File(s)"** entry in this section, which indicates that the files have been successfully uploaded to the system.

## What should I do if the total size of the files I need to upload exceeds 100 MB?

Answer:
The maximum total capacity for a single batch upload on the system is 100 MB. If the total size of multiple files to be uploaded exceeds this limit, please upload the files in separate batches.

## What should I do if the system shows "The current link is no longer valid, please retrieve it again!" after logging in?

Answer:
Please contact the Assistant Editor who sent you the manuscript link via email for assistance in obtaining a new valid link.
